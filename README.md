   late BannerAd bannerAd;

   void _createBannerAd() {
     bannerAd = BannerAd(
       size: AdSize.banner,
       adUnitId: 'your-admob-ad-unit-id',
       listener: BannerAdListener(
         onAdLoaded: (ad) {
           setState(() {
             _isAdReady = true;
           });
         },
         onAdFailedToLoad: (ad, error) {
           print('Ad failed to load: ${error.message}');
         },
       ),
       request: AdRequest(),
     );
     bannerAd.load();
   }
   ```

3. **Display the Ads**:
   Once the ad is loaded, it is displayed within the app's interface using `AdWidget`.
